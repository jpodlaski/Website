                            The Corner Key: Quantity Leads To Quality, And Space For Tyler Herro, As The HEAT Head Toward Game 2

                            In the first half of Game 1, the Cleveland Cavaliers were getting just about anything they wanted. Their Shot Quality – Second Spectrum’s statistic which offers an expected effective field-goal percentage based on shot location and how contested it is – of 59.9 was the highest Miami has allowed any first half this season and the sixth most any team that made the playoffs allowed before halftime. Dunks, layups, open threes, you name it, they were creating it.

                            While the regular season series wasn’t worth much due to the rosters that were available in each game, one constant was that Miami did not get to the rim very often against not only Cleveland’s two-big lineup, but their switching and willingness to help in the paint. Little traction in the halfcourt in the opening minutes, Miami trying to get Andrew Wiggins in the post against one of Cleveland’s guards and the Cavaliers being ready with plenty of help. A 9-2 Cleveland advantage as Donovan Mitchell drove down the right wing for a dunk.

                            After jamming up the Hawks in those opening minutes, it wasn’t the best Miami had played all season, some make-or-miss – Atlanta missing alley-oops, Miami converting on a couple of odd bounces, a significant three-point disparity – keeping them out in front. By the time Haywood Highsmith saved a ball headed out of bounds for what became a beautiful outlet pass and Tyler Herro three, the lead stretched all the way to 17.

                            Miami’s incredible stretch of shooting – particularly early in games – continued from the jump, Alec Burks and Tyler Herro opening with a couple from outside before Bam Adebayo another pair all on his own. Adebayo and Herro combined for 17 of Miami’s first 21, but the Pelicans were almost equally as hot, chipping away when Adebayo and Herro hit the bench, closing the gap to 35-24 after the first.

                            MThe threes kept falling, eventually Miami was 9-of-19 from the arc with the Sixers still looking for their third after those opening minutes. Walker IV hit that third toward the end of the second, the only Sixers to make a shot beyond the arc, but balanced offense around Herro and plenty of shotmaking pushed Miami to a 61-53 advantage. Giving up 32 in the paint wasn’t ideal – if you were looking for a reason why this wasn’t a sizeable lead considering how Miami was shooting, it was Philadelphia’s drives – but it was all enough to get the job done for the time being.
